# Java-Assignment-009 - More with BigInteger Objects

**Instructions:**

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch named Feature01.

## Part 1: Understanding the Objects on the Stack and Heap

**Objective:** You might be sick of the factorial method by now, but we’re going to do one more version.

1. In the class [Big](src/Big.java), write an iterative version of factorial (using a for loop).
2. Write a method to display a table of the integers from 0 to 30 along with their factorials.
    * At some point around 15, you will probably see that the answers are not correct anymore.
    * Why not?

3. Convert factorial so that it performs its calculation using **BigIntegers** and returns a **BigInteger** as a result.
    * You can leave the parameter alone; it will still be an **integer**.
4. Try displaying the table again with your modified factorial method.
    * Is it correct up to 30?
    * How high can you make it go?
